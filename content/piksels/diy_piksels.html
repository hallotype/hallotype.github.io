I made a tutorial how to make your own variable pixel font. <br>
I provide a script that makes the designspace document and an example ufo. I like to use fontmake so that is in this workflow too. You can find all these resource on my GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/hallotype/Piksels">https://github.com/hallotype/Piksels</a>. <br>
