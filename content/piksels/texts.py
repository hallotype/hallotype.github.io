description = '''This Piksels project is an idea for a variable system for pixels fonts.<br>
All the pixel in the glyphs are components. And all the pixel-shapes are present as seperate glyphs.
A scripts builds the designspace according to the various pixel-shapes present and some parameters [ proportion, slant, rotation ], and all the needed sources are generated. Then the variable font can be generated.<br>
In this example I have 7 alphabets, these are accessible via FeatureVariations. '''
