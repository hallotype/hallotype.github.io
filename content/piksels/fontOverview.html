  The working file is a single UFO. Here are all the character sets, the pixels,
  and a temporary pixel for sketching. In the features, the lookups for
  FeatureSubstitution are declared and the rvrn feature is initiated. After the
  font is generated, a custom made GSUB table is merged into the font to make
  the FeatureSubsitions work.
