description = '''This is a fine example where variable fonts and animation go hand in hand.<br>
The phase of a wave repeats over and over to create a smooth animation. Other parameters in this design are the amplitute, wave-length, speed, and direction. <br><br>

I wrote a tool to create this font out of a normal font. To declare the extreme for the amplitude, and all the wave-lengths, the wave-font is generated.<br> '''
