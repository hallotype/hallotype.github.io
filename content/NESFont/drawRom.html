  <b>The sprites</b>
  <br />
  The sprite order in these images is: top to bottom, left to right.<br />
  Starting at $9000, the next 128 sprites look like this.<br /><br />
  <img
    class="img_halfwidth"
    src="content/NESFont/SMB1_$9000.png"
    alt="plaatje"
  />
  <br />
  Let’s ignore the very first 2 sprites; starting with the zero.<br />
  The glyph order is: <b>"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "</b>.<br />
  Notice the space at the end.
  <br />
  Than some sprites we don’t care about, these can be ignored with an
  @-symbol.<br />
  The final glyph order look like:<br />
  <b>glyphOrder = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ @@@-×@!"</b>
  <br /><br />
  So now we know where the font starts: $9000 + 2*$8 = $9010 and we have the
  glyphOrder.

  <b>Draw the font</b><br />
  Since it is all pixels, we need a pixelSize: <b>pixelSize = 100</b>.<br />
  Let’s loop through the glyphOrder and add a glyph to the font. The glyphName
  we can get from the <b>glyphNameFormatter</b> module. <br />
  Starting at $9010, we fetch a byte and draw pixels in the glyph. Every glyph
  is 8 bytes. And.. that is all.<br /><br />
  The most work is finding out where the font-characters are. And define the
  glyphOrder. Sometimes the fonts is not in one place and is scattered in the
  data. An <b>addGlyph(byte, glyphName)</b> would be handy. But, ‘I leave that
  as an exercise’.

  <b>Goodies</b><br />
  Here are some scripts:<br />
  <a href="content/NESFont/DrawRom.py">> DrawRom.py</a> <br />
  <a href="content/NESFont/NESFonter.py">> NESFonter.py</a> <br /><br />
  I can not provide the actual rom files of course.

  on my tutorial, please get in digitally-touch. I am new to these kind of
  tutorial / instructions I want to learn to do better. Find my mail within the
  scripts. <br /><br />Thanks, Thom
