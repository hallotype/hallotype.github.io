  Here is the graphic data set of Super Mario Bros.<br />
  In this game the type is monochome, so there is only one layer. Very
  convenient, the font clearly visible, and extracting is easy.

  For extracting the font, a few parameters are needed:<br />
  <b>></b> the byte where the font starts <br />
  <b>></b> order of characters <br /><br />
  Quite often there is a black character between letters in the rom. I think
  this is because one is the foreground layer and the next is the background (or
  vise versa). For now, I just skip every second character.
