# The making of of the making of 
### my portfolio website.

Every designer knows that making something for yourself is pobably the hardest thing to do. 

_It will never be good enough, 
does this show what i'm capable off?, 
is this finished?,_ 

Also for me this project was not the quickest and easiest. But still, now I have something that was not there before.

Just like my workflow tools in typedesign, I wanted to make a website that was easy to update, edit, maintain and expand if needed.

I am skilled in Python, not so much in internet-languages: html, css, js. So this project was also a learning experience. 

What was on my wishlist, how should the backend work:

typefaces:
- folder of typefaces, these should be processed to view on the website,
- variable fonts: generate a block of code that I could easily copypaste into any part of the website. The block of code should contain the rendered type, and controles for the variations.

projects:
- every project has its own folder with texts, images and addtional information for generate static pages.
