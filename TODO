- subsetter
- variable support
  + added sliders to var fonts:
    + min/max/def values

    - write js to update css onChange
    - touch events!

- add a grid view
  - switcher line-up and grid view

ideas for 2021
- support UFO, a path to UFO as only ref?
  - compile otf > woff2 > base64 on the fly


done:

+ seperate all font css for faster loading, 20200605
+ convert to woff2
  + woff2 > base64 
  + ignore font files
+ var
  > add sliders
  > have correct values
  > works with mouse events
  ! need to fix for touch
+ PAN is only caps, rebuild the fonts or some how via a sep text file telling the main script this is a caps only font?
  > added  checkCharSet script, looks into cmap if /a and /A is in cmap that tell if 
    lowercase, uppercase  is in font.
